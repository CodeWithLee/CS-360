Weight Tracker Mobile Application

•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The Weight Tracker app I developed was designed to allow users to log in, manage data in a database, and receive SMS notifications. It checks if a user has an account and lets them create one if needed. The database shell lets users add, delete, update, and view items in a grid layout. The app also asks for SMS permission to send alerts based on user actions but still works if permission is denied. This app was built to address user needs for secure login, simple weight data management, and optional notifications.

•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app needed a login screen, a database management screen with a grid view, and a permission request screen for SMS alerts. I kept users in mind by making the login simple, organizing the database items clearly in a grid, and making sure the app still worked even if users denied SMS permission. My designs were successful because they were easy to navigate, focused on the main tasks users needed to complete, and made sure users always had a smooth experience no matter what choices they made.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached coding the app by breaking down the project into smaller tasks like setting up login authentication, building the database shell, and adding SMS permission handling. I used step-by-step testing in the Android Emulator to catch issues early. I also focused on making sure each part worked before moving to the next. These techniques helped me stay organized and made debugging easier. In the future, I can apply this strategy to bigger projects by planning out tasks first and testing often during development.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested my code by running the app in the Android Emulator after finishing each major feature, like login, database actions, and SMS permissions. I tried different scenarios, like logging in with a new user, adding and deleting items, and denying SMS permissions. Testing is important because it catches bugs early and makes sure the app works like users expect. It revealed a few small errors, like the database not updating right away, which I was able to fix before finishing.

•	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During the app design and development process, I had to innovate when setting up the database grid view. At first, the data wasn’t displaying correctly, so I had to research how to properly connect the database to the grid layout. I ended up changing how I retrieved and displayed the data, which made the app much smoother. This challenge pushed me to be flexible and look for new solutions instead of sticking to my first plan.

•	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge and skills in the login and authentication part of the app. I made sure users could create accounts and log in securely, and the app handled errors like wrong passwords. This showed my understanding of user authentication, data validation, and user-friendly design, which are important skills for mobile app development.
